> Download the '20_newsgroups' from 'http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups' containing the 20 directories & place it in this directory.

> To run this, you will have to change the paths in the 'Vocabulary Builder.ipynb', 'Train Database Builder.ipynb' & 'Test Database Builder.ipynb' files to this directory



1st run 'Vocabulary Builder.ipynb' to build the vocabulary of 5000 words

Next run 'Train Database Builder.ipynb' & 'Test Database Builder.ipynb' to build the training & testing datasets

Finally run 'Text Classification using inbuilt NaiveBayes.ipynb' to make predictions using the inbuilt classifier

or run 'Text Classification using self NaiveBayes.ipynb' to make predictions using self-written code

NOTE: used 2000 words vocab to do the classification



RESULTS:

using inbuilt:
training - 89% precision
testing - 85% precision

using self-written code:
training - 90% precision
testing - 87% precision
